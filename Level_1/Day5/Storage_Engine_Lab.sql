-- Support means Indicates whether the storage engine is available and usable in MySQL.
-- XA means Indicates whether the engine supports XA Transactions (Distributed Transactions).
-- Savepoints means Indicates whether the engine supports SAVEPOINT inside transactions.

-- 1. CREATE TABLES WITH DIFFERENT STORAGE ENGINES
-- =====================================================

-- 2. INSERT SAMPLE DATA
-- =====================================================

INSERT INTO customers_innodb (customer_name, email)
VALUES
('Aung Aung', 'aung@example.com'),
('Su Su', 'susu@example.com'),
('Kyaw Kyaw', 'kyaw@example.com');

INSERT INTO customers_myisam (customer_name, email)
SELECT customer_name, email FROM customers_innodb;

-- 3. TRANSACTION TEST
-- InnoDB supports ROLLBACK
-- MyISAM, MEMORY, CSV, ARCHIVE do not support real rollback
-- =====================================================

START TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO customers_innodb (customer_name, email)
VALUES ('Rollback Test InnoDB', 'rollback_innodb@example.com');

VALUES ('Rollback Test MyISAM', 'rollback_myisam@example.com');

-- Expected:
-- InnoDB record disappears after rollback.
-- MyISAM record remains because MyISAM is non-transactional.

-- =====================================================
-- 4. UPDATE TEST
-- =====================================================

UPDATE customers_innodb
SET email = 'updated_innodb@example.com'
WHERE customer_id = 1;

UPDATE customers_myisam
SET email = 'updated_myisam@example.com'
WHERE customer_id = 1;

UPDATE customers_memory
SET email = 'updated_memory@example.com'
WHERE customer_id = 1;

-- CSV may not support UPDATE properly depending on MySQL version
-- Try this:
UPDATE customers_csv
SET email = 'updated_csv@example.com'
WHERE customer_id = 1;

-- ARCHIVE usually does not support UPDATE
UPDATE customers_archive
SET email = 'updated_archive@example.com'
WHERE customer_id = 1;

-- 5. DELETE TEST
-- =====================================================

DELETE FROM customers_innodb WHERE customer_id = 2;
DELETE FROM customers_myisam WHERE customer_id = 2;
DELETE FROM customers_memory WHERE customer_id = 2;

-- CSV / ARCHIVE may give errors depending on version
DELETE FROM customers_csv WHERE customer_id = 2;
